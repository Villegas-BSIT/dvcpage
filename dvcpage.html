  <h3 style="font-size:1em;color:#255, 255, 255; text-align:justify; letter-spacing: 0.5px; margin-top:20px;"> 
☆   Davao Vision Colleges, Inc. (DVC) is a faith-centered institution that offers cross-cultural education with a focus on academic, personal, and spiritual growth. While specific historical details like founding dates are not in the provided search results, the college emphasizes its commitment to creating a multicultural community and fostering a space for spiritual reflection through its chapel services.<br>     
☆   In 2007, Rev. Dr. Kim Wun Sun, the senior pastor and chairman of the board of Yeomchang Central Presbyterian Church in Seoul, South Korea, had a vision to start a Christian college to train students into leaders and become local or foreign missionaries to other countries with their different field of expertise.
Through the help of Rev. David Sang, a Korean missionaries assigned in Mindanao particularly in Davao City, three hectares of land was purchased purposely for the school. Rev. Iluminado D. Macahig Jr., a Filipino Pastor, Dr. Cheol Woo Lee, a Korean Missionary and President of the
Koinonia Theological Seminary, and some other Korean missionaries helped in the process of establishing DVC.<br>
☆   In 2008, Rev. Kim In Han, a Korean missionary from Seoul, South Korea who was previously assigned as missionary to China, 
was commissioned to help administer the college particularly in the supervision of the funds in the construction of buildings and preparation of related documents for CHED Recognition to start the college.<br>
☆   Dr. Fidel Japos, one of the supervisors in the Department of Education (DepEd) Regional Office XI, was asked to help inthe preparation of the documents. 
Together with Dr. Rosita J. Bustamante, Chief Program Specialist of CHED Regional Office, and Rev. Abdon C. Canonoy Jr., a former Dean of one of the colleges in Davao, the College Board was created in April of 2008.<br>
☆   With the collaborative efforts of Dr. Bustamante and Rev. Canonoy, the SEC Registration and Application of permits for 5 courses to the CHED office were realized. 
SEC registration was formally approved on April 30, 2008 and CHED permits of Bachelor of Arts in Theology (AB-Theology), 
Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), Bachelor of Elementary Education (BEEd), Bachelor of Secondary Education (BSEd), and Bachelor of Science and Information Technology (BSIT) were approved in February 2009.
